excerpt: Shane has given a lot of Lightning Talks
---

I've given a lot of lightning talks over the years.  Some of them, I even remember!  There is the year I gave the Lightning Talk titled "Why I'm Not Writing A Lightning Talk This Year", of course.

Here are my often incomplete notes of lighting talks from the past, along with a few video links where we had video for the talks.  Some talks were clearly of the "you had to be there" type, but some of these have important messages for thinking about effective Apache-style communities.
