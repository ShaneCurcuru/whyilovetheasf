excerpt: Shane has given a lot of Lightning Talks
---

I've given a lot of lightning talks over the years.  Some of them, I even remember!  There is the year I gave the Lightning Talk titled "Why I'm Not Writing A Lightning Talk This Year", of course.

Here are my often incomplete notes of lighting talks from the past, along with a few video links where we had video for the talks.  Some talks were clearly of the "you had to be there" type, but many of these have important messages for thinking about effective Apache-style communities.

# 2006-2007 Why I Love The ASF

Sadly, all notes from this have been lost.  But it was heartfelt and included me leading a singalong, so perhaps someone has video of it somewhere.

I also wrote a great "Internationally Why I Love The ASF" for ApacheCon 2007 in Amsterdam, but sadly they ran out of time before calling my name!  That was a shame, since I had practiced saying "Why I Love The ASF" in a number of different languages (which of course, I've mostly forgotten!)

Oh - I ended up giving a modified version of "Internationally Why I Love The ASF" the following year - again in Amsterdam.

# 2008 Nakedly Why I Love The ASF

Putting it all out there and baring my soul.  Yes, I took my shirt off.  There's proof - they took pictures.

# 2009 Statistically, Why I Love The ASF

All the numbers of why I love the ASF, from various scripts running our our corporate data.

There are 3262 iclas recorded
There are 60 iclas with potentially non-public names (i.e. people using nom de plume for contributions)
There are 2132 committers with availids
There are 1081 committers' MailAliases

And my renowned super-fast reading of every Apache project name at the time:

Abdera    ActiveMQ     Ant     APR     Archiva    Beehive     Buildr      Camel    Cayenne    Cocoon    Commons     Continuum     CouchDB    CXF    DB 
Directory  Excalibur    Felix    Forrest     Geronimo    Gump     Hadoop     Harmony    HTTP Server 
HttpComponents    iBATIS   Incubator    
Ace     Aries    Bluesky    Cassandra    Chemistry    Click    Droids    Empire-db    Etch    ESME   Hama

# 2010 Alphabetically, Why I love the ASF

I've spoken at nearly every ApacheCon Lightning Talk, with titles ranging from the classic original “Why I love the ASF”, (now on it's way to platinum on Decca Records,) flying over to Internationally Why I love the ASF (presented in Amsterdam), Nakedly Why I love the ASF, (in front of an all over 21 crowd), Statistically Why I love the ASF, (with a margin of error of 3%), and Repeatedly why I love the ASF, and Repeatedly why I love the ASF, and Repeatedly why I love the ASF, and so on.

Now in all seriousness, I would like to do a quick review of who and what makes up the Apache Software Foundation, 
There are 3701 iclas recorded, 295 CCLAS recorded and There are 2446 individual committers accounts
We host about 89 top level projects with a total of 1664 PMC members, plus another 41 Incubator Podlings.
The ASF has over 100 corporate officers, including for the first time ever, a Chair of Vice, Excuse me, I mean a Vice Chairman of the Board.

Along with our crack infrastructure team, security team, Vice Presidents for JCP, Travel, W3C, Legal, Fundraising, Marketing, Branding, AND the ASF has the following projects:
 Abdera,  ActiveMQ,  Ant,  APR,  Archiva,  Attic,  Avro,  Axis,  Buildr, blah blah blah
 C++ Standard Library,  Camel,  Cassandra,  Cayenne,  Click, Cocoon, Commons
 Community Development,  Conference Planning, (phew)
 Continuum,  CouchDB,  CXF,  DB,  Directory,  Excalibur, Felix,  Forrest
 Geronimo,  Gump,  Hadoop,  Harmony,  Hbase,  Hive,  HttpComponents,  HTTP Server,  Incubator, blah blah blah
 Jackrabbit,  Jakarta,  JAMES,  jUDDI,  Karaf,  Labs , Lenya, Logging, Lucene
 Mahout,  Maven,  MINA,  MyFaces,  Nutch,  ODE,  OFBiz,  OpenEJB,  OpenJPA,  OpenWebBeans, OpenTCK., Open Blah blah blah
 PDFBox,  Perl,  Pig,  Pivot,  POI,  Portals, Qpid,  Roller
 Santuario,  ServiceMix,  Shindig,  Shiro,  Sling,  SpamAssassin,  Struts, Subversion,  Synapse,  
Tapestry , Tcl,  Thrift,  Tika,  Tiles,  Tomcat,  Traffic Server , Turbine , Tuscany
 UIMA,  Velocity,  Web Services,  Wicket , Xalan , Xerces , XML , XML Graphics , XMLBeans

Aaaaaaannnnnndddd – you get the picture.

As of next month, with the expected graduation of the Apache Zookeeper project from incubation, we will be almost complete in our Alphabetical Domination!  As I've spoken for several years, we're this close to covering the alphabet with our top level projects!  So Please – I urge everyone – support any projects with names that start with Y, and encourage them hatch from incubation as quickly as possible.  Community diversity?!  1.0 release?  Who cares!  We need action now on a Y project, for I fear the forces of functional energy on our Excalibur project are fast failing; as has been said, the Attic is Hungry!

And I could go on talking for another 45 minutes, and eventually nobody would understand a word I’m saying, and you’d all be fidling with your Androids and commenting on Facebook and wondering what Bob Sutor is really going to say tomorrow.
But that’s not what I came here to talk about.

Came to talk about an announcement.

Many of you may not be aware that I began professional life as a software quality engineer.  Yes, it's true, I used to be a tester.  In fact the very first blurb on my resume was “Co-wrote automated /Data Query external macro test harness covering over 25 square feet of 10-pt Arial printouts.”  In the days since then, I've worked in automated unit testing, code generated UI testing harnesses, and XSL conformance testing to W3C specs – before going on to fame as a world travelling Lighting Talk speaker and Vice President of Blah Blah Blah here at the Apache Software Foundation.
So I believe I'm uniquely qualified to announce the newest Apache-related project : I'm pleased to announce the formation of a new non profit devoted to providing RAND free and fair test conformance sets for coffee-based specifications.  Please join me in welcoming the newest, soon-to-be certified OSI-and ROHS-compliant, truly community-led and driven, open source testing consortium:
Open TCK!
Say it with me: Open TCK!  Open TCK!  Open T C K!
We're in the very first stages of starting up, so please see me afterward for more details; membership is open to all individuals wearing their own hats. 
 And someone, please – reserve the website for us now, before the word gets out.

# 2011 Why I'm Not Writing My Lightning Talk This Year (Vancouver)

Past talks I've given include:
Why I love the ASF
Statistically, Why I love the ASF
Nakedly, Why I love the ASF
Alphabetically, I love the ASF
Internationally, Why I love the ASF

Why I love the internationally alphabetically statistically really naked ASF
/ You can hack anything you want /
/ At the good old ASF! /
(To the tune of Alice's Restaurant)
I've given a fair number of Lightning Talks at ApacheCon, but I wanted to tell you all why I'm not writing my Lightning Talk this year.   You see, I'm a bit disappointed.
I've been wearing my heart on my sleeve here for years, proclaming my love for the ASF, singing you love songs even, but I'm not sure you're listening - and I'm not sure I'm feeling the love back.

My first lightning talk was "Why I love the ASF"

And I've started every year with heartfelt stories of the public good that we all do, the fact that our software powers half the computers in the world, the fact that free and open source software enables so many nonprofits and charities and individuals, and yes, and even big businesses to do so many cool things with computers. About how we're all a big family, and community over code and all that stuff.

But who really wants to hear about that?  Who really wants to see me get all sappy and heartfelt?  you sure don't.  I mean, I know you don't want to hear me sing.  Except maybe Delia and Charel.

Then I gave a talk about "Statistically, Why I love the ASF"

But who cares about statistics?  Who cares that we have thousands of committers, hundreds of members, almost a hundred projects, and gods know how many incubator podlings, since that number changes every hour.

And I mean, who can really understand me when I read the list of all the Apache projects like this:

Abdera, ActiveMQ, Ant, APR, Archiva, Aries, Avro, Axis, Buildr, Camel, Cassandra, Cayenne, Chemistry, Click,
, Cocoon, Commons, Continuum, CouchDB, CXF, DB, Directory, ESME, Felix, Forrest, Geronimo
, Gump, Hadoop, Harmony, HBase, Hive, HttpComponents, HTTP Server, Jackrabbit, Jakarta (rest in peace)
, James, jUDDI, Karaf, Lenya, Libcloud, Logging, Lucene, Mahout, Maven, Mina, MyFaces, YourFaces, TheirFaces,
, Nutch, ODE, OODT, OFBiz, OpenEJB, OpenJPA, OpenWebBeans, (Open)PDFBox,
, Perl, Pig, Pivot, POI, Portals, Qpid, River, Roller
, Santuario, ServiceMix, Shindig, Shiro, Sling, SpamAssassin, STDCXX, Struts, Subversion, Synapse
, Tapestry, Tcl, Thrift, Tika, Tiles, Tomcat, TrafficServer, Turbine, Tuscany, UIMA
, Velocity, Web Services, Whirr, Wicket, Xalan, Xerces, XML, XMLBeans, XML Graphics, Zoo Keeper

Speaking of which, I've also spoken about how "Alphabetically, I love the ASF".  I've done this twice now, But you're not listening!  We've been so close to achieveing alphabetical domination, but we've let it slip through our grasp!
We were nearly at our goal, and we let iBatis slip away.  We've lost our only "I" named project!  We're sliding backwards, not moving forwards!  
And where's my "Y"?  How or when will we ever know who knows what we are without a "Y"?  Where's my "Y"?
----
And of course, I've talked about "Nakedly, Why I love the ASF".

But I've seen the ASF naked, and I assure you, it's not pretty.  So let's just not go there.
----
Now, I've travelled many miles around the world to talk about how "Internationally, Why I love the ASF"

I've poured my heart out everywhere I've gone, and what have I got for it?  
Where has that gotten me to?  Canada?
I mean, Vancouver is a beautiful city, and everyone here is super nice.  But Canada?  Really?
----
And finally, I could have written a lightning talk this year called "Why I love the Apache (trademark) Brand".  I really could have, I really should have, I mean, I'm the brand guy.  But why bother?

I've been wearing one of these big "ASK ME" buttons with the feather ever since we had them, every day.  Pretty obvious don't you think?  A beautiful invitation to ask me about Apache, about our brand, our projects, our communities.
But who's asked?  No-one!  Not one single person has asked me about my ask me.  Not one.
----
So yes, dear ASF.  I still love you.  But I'm not sure I'm feeling the love back.  I think we might need to spend a little time apart.
At least until ... next year at ApacheCon!

# 2012 Lightning Talk
Another Why I Love The ASF Talk

# 2013 Governmentally, Why I Love The ASF (Portland, Feb)

Good evening, my name is Shane Curcuru, and I'm an ApacheCon Lightning Talk Junkie. Past ApacheCons have seen me share my love - and my gift for song - for this great Foundation, the ASF. Looking and collecting together past Lightning Talks I've given, I can say that I really really love the internationally alphabetical, statistically naked ASF.
But tonight, I will be talking about: Governmentally, Why I Love The ASF.
Now many of you may have heard in the news of the looming US federal government budget sequestrations; that is, a significant cutting across the board of federal funding for a wide variety of programs here in the US.
Despite the influence that the ASF has through the installation of influentual Apache members and committers within key areas of the Federal Government, including in the executive branch and especially in NASA - due to the expected sequestration cuts coming, it is my sad duty to announce several changes to the well-known Apache Way.
I'd like to lay out our bold new vision for the what we will be calling: The Nopache Way.
Yes! Let us all embrace the new Nopatche Way - that's N O P A T C H E space W A Y.

Some of the changes to be announced as part of our Nopache way program include:
A common saying is "Patches Welcome". Sadly, due to the inefficiencies present in the current system of undirected or misdirected - or just plain lazy – volunteers, all future code patches will require complete documentation, unit test scripts, and sample data before submission, including a full waiver of liability. We are working on a JIRA plugin to enforce these constraints.

Similarly, there is a tremendous amount of energy effectively wasted in long-winded consensus seeking. This kind of behavior all too often takes on a life of it's own and distracts us from our real job here, which is pushing our own ideas into Apache products.
Therefore we are making an update to our mailing lists. Any email message that is in reply to a [VOTE] thread email will only accept the bare characters of + plus sign and - minus sign in the content of the message; all other content will be stripped. This will ensure a quick and definitive resolution of all issues without distracting tangents about principles, alternate viewpoints, or paint colors for bikesheds.

Also to promote the general welfare and sanity of all Apache committers, HTML emails shall be immediately banned from all lists.

Due to the general trend in downsizing, we are also spinning off the less... interesting and exciting projects from the Apache Software Foundation.
The overhead of supporting SVN, git, websites, bug trackers, fifteen different wiki installations, and all the other legal, press and brand management headaches for these projects is no longer supportable under the Nopache Way.
Notified projects will be given one week to clean out their desks and to migrate their code to their new home at SourceForge. Projects being notified should contact Rich Bowen for a free consultation with professional grief counselors.

Similarly, to show that the Apache community is fully doing it's part to save costs for our customers, the branding guidelines for project websites are being updated to enforce a critical cost savings idea introduced at an ApacheCon LightningTalk by long-time member Lars Eilebrect. The program is called "Go to black", wherein all websites will use a black background and an absolute minimum of text and graphics, resulting in a major cost savings in reduced computer monitor electrical consumption around the world.

Again, we are sorry to announce these changes to the Nopache Way, But please - please - don't worry. I can still categorically state that yes, Governmentally, I still love the ASF.

# 2014 What I Don't Love About The ASF (Denver, Apr)

I've given a lot of lightning talks over the years, after giving my now legendary first lighting talk, “Why I Love The ASF” so many years ago.
Internationally alphabetical.... collated
Nakedly statistical... you don't want to know
But the ASF continues to grow in projects, even if we haven't covered the alphabet yet - this year, let's try it backwards!
ZooKeeper, XMLBeans, XML Graphics, Xerces,  Xalan,  Wookie,  Wink,  Wicket,  
Whirr,  Web Services,  Velocity,  VCL,  UIMA,  Tuscany,  Turbine,  Traffic Server,

Any23,  Ant,  Ambari,  Allura,  Airavata,  ActiveMQ,  ACE,  Accumulo, Abdera

There are a few things I don't like about the ASF:
The Incubator website
The apache.org Website: Like your childhood blanky, so yes, you love it but can't take in public
The projects.apache.org website.  No single person alive actually understands all of the different technologies used to not make it work.
The fact we still don't have a project that starts with the letter Y
The last 10 seconds of any lightning talk, or the end of any ApacheCon
Alexis Park Hotel in Las Vegas - whether under construction or not!

# 2015 Lightning Talk – Austin (Apr)
I didn't write a lightning talk this year, sorry to disappoint... _(walks off stage)_.

_(returns to stage to laughter)_

No, actually, I recapped one of the most powerful Lightning Talks I've ever seen, called **The Most Important Thing I Do Everyday At ApacheCon** ([you have to see the video](ttps://youtu.be/fQAAzpk4oQ4?list=WL&t=2869)).

# 2015 Lightning Talk – Budapest (Nov)
Yet another amazing Lightning Talk!  I've got the notes here somewhere!

# 2016 Lightning Talk – Vancouver (May)
Yet another amazing Lightning Talk!  I've got the notes here somewhere!

# 2016 Lightning Talk – Seville (Sept)
Yet another amazing Lightning Talk!  I've got the notes here somewhere!

# 2017 Five Things I Never Could Have Imagined Doing (Miami)

Rich Bowen took up the mantle of giving a why I love the ASF LightningTalk this year, so I choose something completely different.

See the [slides the video over on ShaneSlides](http://shaneslides.com/2017/05/Five-Things-I-Couldnt-Imagine/).


# 2018 Five Things You Might Not Know About ApacheCon
# ApacheCon NA 2018 - Montréal

## 0. Does Apache Have A URL Shortening Service?

Yes! Creating permanent, ASF hosted short links is open to all committers:

https://s.apache.org/

Why is this important?  Because the ASF will be here in 50 years, so our shortened URLs will still be here for the public good.

## 1. What is a PMC?

PMC = Project Managment Committee

https://s.apache.org/about-pmc

Apache PMCs are the leadership team helping to drive their Apache project.

Imagine a giant org chart.  The ASF Board is at the top, and then all 200 independent Apache top level projects have a dotted line report to the board - but the reporting is only about legal, community, and branding issues - NOT about technical issues.  One of the hardest things to understand is that the ASF - the Foundation - does not provide technical direction or even suggestions for our projects.  It's up to each PMC to independently decide what's right for their community and choose their direction.

## 2. How Do I Become An Apache Member / Get A Seat On The Board?

Use the Apache Way to serve the public good.

https://s.apache.org/about-independence

You can't pay to get a seat on the board, unlike some other foundations.  If you're asking to be made a member, that's the wrong way to go about it.

New members are nominated and elected on merit by the existing membership.  It's not about where you work, it's not about how much code you've contributed, and it's never about what you've donated or funded.  It's always about: how have you shown the values of The Apache Way by helping drive forward and evangelize multiple Apache projects?

This level of independence ensures the ASF board can't be subverted.  The board ensures the strategic independence of Apache projects from any vendor or consortia.

## 3. Well, What Is An Apache Member?

It's probably not what you think.

https://s.apache.org/about-members

On one hand, it's pretty boring.  Members are each a single shareholder of the corporation, and get a single vote for our annual board election.  On the other hand, it's a huge honor to be recognized for your merit in helping multiple Apache communities succeed and grow.

Members don't get any direct privledges on Apache projects; you can't just show up and commit code.  But Members do have visibility into projects: as shareholders, they help provide the oversignt of both foundation business and to a degree all project business.  It doesn't mean they can change the technical direction of any project; but it does mean they can help mentor our many communities.

## 4. How Can I Be Successful At Apache?

https://s.apache.org/about-success

Sometime we need instructions for what steps to take, or what process we need to follow to accomplish a goal.  But sometimes we need help figuring out what questions to ask, or we need to understand the why behind the process.  Sometimes, reading the documentation won't help us - but hearing a story from someone else in our situation will help us make sense of it all.

A number of ASF Members write the Success at Apache blog series, essays about how they've found success in their work, their community, or just in their life when working with Apache projects.  These are stories - human explanations of what it means to be part of an Apache project and what you can get out of it.  Check them out.

## 5. How Do I Get Infra Things For My Project?

You have to **ask** for them.  Preferably clearly and politely.

https://s.apache.org/about-infra

Projects commonly feel like they don't know the right way to ask for new infrastructure resources that the ASF provides.  It's actually pretty simple - just ask.  It's super helpful to ask in the right forum, to make your question clear, and to be polite.  The crack Apache Infra team are paid staff, their job is to help our projects, and they're all friendly like ponies.

Also - when in doubt asking infra for something, file an INFRA JIRA issue.  They like tickets.

Oh, and Apache Infra is looking to hire a new staffer!  If you like Ponies, fight the good fight against gnomes gumming up the works, then apply to get paid to work for Apache!
