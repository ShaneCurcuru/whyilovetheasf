Learning about the ASF and how Apache projects work can seem like a
daunting task.  Luckily, along with the
[welcoming signposts at Community Development](http://community.apache.org/),
I have some pointers for you!

What do you want to learn about today?

**Technology**

We [list all 170+ Apache projects](https://projects.apache.org/) and technologies.  There is a complete [developer information portal under /dev](http://www.apache.org/dev/).

**Code**

All project code at Apache is publicly available and in [Subversion or Git repositories](http://www.apache.org/dev/#version-control).


**Contact Anyone**

Everything at Apache happens on [our many mailing lists](http://www.apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html).
Finding the [right list to use](http://www.apache.org/dev/contrib-email-tips.html#rightlist) is important.  In particular, every Apache project has their own dev@/user@
mailing lists - **all** technical questions should be asked
on that project's list, not an overall Apache one.  Only for cross-project
issues should you contact a [top-level Apache address](http://www.apache.org/foundation/contact).

Most mailing lists are [publicly archived](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/).

**People**

The [Home directory](http://home.apache.org/) lists Apache Committers and Members by project.

**Legal**

Virtually everything the ASF produces is under the [Apache License, version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/foundation/contact).  Any questions about
anything legal related go to the [Legal Affairs Committee](http://www.apache.org/legal/).

**Trademarks**

The ASF [owns all trademarks on behalf of Apache projects.](http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/)  The name and
logo of [every project and software product](http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/list/) are trademarks or registered
trademarks of the ASF.

**Press**

The ASF has an excellent [Media and Analyst relations team](http://www.apache.org/press/) that runs
[@TheASF](https://twitter.com/TheASF) and the [official Foundation Blog](https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/).

**Corporate/Governance**

The ASF is a [501C3 non-profit](http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/), membership corporation and public charity that relies on
[individual donors](http://www.apache.org/foundation/contributing.html) and [sponsors](http://www.apache.org/foundation/sponsorship.html) for [funding and budgets](https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the_apache_software_foundation_asf).
Our Members elect a [Board of Directors](http://www.apache.org/foundation/) that appoints Officers, and a detailed [governance overview and org chart](http://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/) is posted.

**Infrastructure**

The crack [Apache Infrastructure team](http://www.apache.org/dev/#infrastructure) runs all the
machines, clouds, and services used by the ASF and Apache projects.  Some projects
run non-critical (testing, additional docs, etc.) resources for themselves.
