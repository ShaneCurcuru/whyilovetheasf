Still having a hard time finding the right FAQ?  Here's a quick guide to finding the right FAQ for your Q!

## How can I get involved at Apache?

Just get started by [emailing your ideas or questions](https://community.apache.org/newcomers/index.html) to an Apache project you're interested in.It's up to you to start - the best things to work on are ones **you** are interested in.  The [Community Development project](https://community.apache.org) is here to help point you in the right direction.

## How can I become an Apache committer?

_First_ - [find a project you are interested in](https://projects.apache.org/projects.html?category).  The best way to get involved is to use an Apache software product that you have a **reason** to use (even if just curiosity), and then ask questions or [submit code patches](http://www.apache.org/dev/contributors#patches) to [that project's mailing lists](https://www.apache.org/dev/contrib-email-tips.html#rightlist).

It's all up to you - [Apache projects run on merit](http://theapacheway.com/merit/), which means people who do more work _on that project_ - as measured by the community - get more of a say.

## How many Apache projects are there?

See [all 190+ Apache software projects](https://projects.apache.org/) and read the [developer information portal](https://www.apache.org/dev/).

## How do mailing lists work at Apache?  Where should I email to ask questions?

Everything at Apache happens on [archived mailing lists](https://www.apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html).
Find the [right list to use](https://www.apache.org/dev/contrib-email-tips.html#rightlist).
Technical questions **always** go to that project's dev@ list - every project is independent and separate. Or, to ask cross-project questions.
Reading the [Apache mail archives](https://lists.apache.org/) is a great way to see what other people are asking.

## How is Apache software licensed?  Is it free to use?

Apache software uses the [Apache License, version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/).  Questions? [Contact the Legal Affairs Committee](https://www.apache.org/legal/). Apache PMCs with _specific_ questions: [open a LEGAL Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/LEGAL/).

## Where can I find press releases or analyst briefings?

## How do Apache projects work?  What's this Apache Way I've heard about?

Learn about [The Apache Way](https://theapacheway.com/), our community-led consensus behaviors that make Apache projects so efficient and long-lived, or [view presentations about the ApacheWay](http://shaneslides.com/2017/04/History-Of-The-Apache-Way/).

## Are donations to the ASF needed?  Can I deduct them from my taxes?

Our non-profit relies on [individual Donors](https://www.apache.org/foundation/contributing) and [annual Sponsors](https://www.apache.org/foundation/sponsorship) for our[funding and budgets](https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the-apache-software-foundation-operations2).
