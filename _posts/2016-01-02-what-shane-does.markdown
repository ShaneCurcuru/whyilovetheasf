excerpt: My Apache Resume - Director, VP, Documentation

Looking back, I'm often reminded at just how long I've been involved
at the ASF.  While the "[Apache Group](http://www.apache.org/history/)" formed in
the 1990's, before dot-com, the founders used email to share
patches to one of the very original web servers.  It wasn't until
1999 that they incorporated the ASF, primarily at the time to provide
a legal shield for their code contributions to what was becoming a
very popular technology.

Shortly after incorporation, IBM and Sun jointly got together to donate
all the parts of an XML/XSLT processing stack to the ASF as independent
projects.  Since my job was test lead for the LotusXSL processor, I then
became a committer and PMC member in the brand new Apache Xalan project.

This was the very early days, when Apache wasn't well known, and open source
collaboration was a new field.  I thought it was a great way to work, so
I got involved volunteering beyond just testing for Apache Xalan.  This work
led me to volunteering for the Conferences Committee which organized
ApacheCons in 2002, and shortly thereafter being elected as a Member
of the ASF.

With my newfound Member powers I got to explore how other early projects
at the ASF worked like Jakarta and the conference world.  I also volunteered
in the early days of the Public Relations Committee (PRC), where a bunch of
geeks tried to devise a way to do analyst and press relations themselves,
without paying for any experts.

The story from PRC to VP, Brand is a long one, which will be told soon.
