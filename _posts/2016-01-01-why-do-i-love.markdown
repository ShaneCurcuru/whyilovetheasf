excerpt: Why Shane loves Apache so much
---

You might be wondering: what the heck is Shane talking about, that
he loves the ASF - the Apache Software Foundation - so much?  He's built
this whole website about it, and even given a number of talks about
this before.  It's kind of strange to love an organization, don't you think?

The biggest point for me is the people.  The Membership of the ASF is like a great
big family.  While everything else about the work of the AFS is important - the public charity;
the way we work via consensus, not hierarchy; the cool projects
and communities and technologies; and thie history - it's really
the people that keeps me volunteering at Apache.

While plenty of committers working on different projects are just there
for the code, many of the Members and evangelists for the Apache 
are so much more involved with the **community**.  It's about finding 
better ways for groups of people to work together on shared goals - not 
just improving the code, but helping all of us improve the work 
we do with the technology. 

And giving goofy [Lighting Talks at ApacheCon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAAzpk4oQ4).  (more to come!)

I've met a lot of great people at ApacheCon throughout the years
(since 2001), and hope to see people at <a href="http://apachecon.com/">ApacheCon/BigData</a>, coming
to Miami, Florida this 16-18 May 2017!
