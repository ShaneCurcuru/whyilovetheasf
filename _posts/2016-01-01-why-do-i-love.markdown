excerpt: Why Shane loves Apache so much
---

You might be wondering: what the heck is Shane talking about, that
he loves the ASF - the Apache Software Foundation - so much?  He's built
this whole website about it, and even given a number of talks about
this before.  It's kind of strange to love an organization, don't you think?

It's about the people.  The Membership of the ASF is like a great
big family.  While everything else is important - the public charity;
the way we work via consensus, not hierarchy; the cool projects
and communities and technologies; and thie history - it's really
the people that keeps me volunteering at Apache.

And giving goofy [Lighting Talks at ApacheCon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAAzpk4oQ4).  (more to come!)
