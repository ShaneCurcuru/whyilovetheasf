excerpt: Shane has given a lot of Lightning Talks
---

[ApacheCon](http://apachecon.com/) is the official annual conference for all Apache projects and communities.
On of our traditional evening events are the LightningTalks, where
anyone is welcome to 5 minutes on the stage to speak informally on almost any topic.
Beer and refreshments are served, and the 5 minute limit is strictly enforced.
We have some technology talks about new projects, but usually our speakers
are focused on communities and humorous stories.


### Lightning Talk, ApacheCon, Budapest, 2015, Project Listing

Imagine this read in a really fast voice, like the old [Federal Express fast talker](https://youtu.be/NeK5ZjtpO-M?t=20) ads - this is one of my
traditional parts of a Lighning Talk, pointing out just
how many projects are at Apache!
