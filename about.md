          This is Shane's website about Why I Love The ASF.  It is an unofficial resource with useful pointers and humorous stories about how Apache really works, and is a companion to my essay-focused
          <a href="http://communityovercode.com/">Community Over Code</a> blog.
          As well as a variety of other sites.

          As with the internet itself, this site is a work in progress.  It's
          both a showcase of my feelings, a place for me to put useful
          content at stable URLs, and is a way to finally learn how
          CSS actually works.  Well, at least as well as anyone does!
